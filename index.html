                        <p>It is almost impossible for us to imagine mathematics without something as seemingly simple
                            as a calculator. That being said, the calculators we know today were not invented until the
                            1970s, and the use of smartphones as calculators did not begin until at least the late
                            nineties. But that doesn’t mean that mathematical tools were not available before the 20th
                            century—there were many different computing machines created long before digital calculators
                            and smartphones.</p>
